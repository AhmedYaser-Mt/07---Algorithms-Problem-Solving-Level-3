# 📘 07 - Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 3 (Programming Advices)

🎉 I’m excited to share that I’ve completed the **07 – Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 3** course from **Programming Advices**, taught by **Dr. Mohamed Abou Hadhoud**. 🏆  

This repository contains **50 solved problems** from this level, each crafted to strengthen logical thinking, problem decomposition, and an efficiency mindset.

## 🚀 Course Overview
Level 3 in the Abu Hadhoud series further challenged my problem-solving skills.  
The main focus was tackling **50 progressively challenging algorithmic problems**, each enhancing:
- Logical structuring
- Code efficiency
- Reusable functions design

---

## 💡 Key Highlights
- 🔹 **Breaking down complex tasks** into clean, reusable functions—each with a single, well-defined purpose.
- 🔹 Writing **optimised code** under real constraints, not just theoretical ones.
- 🔹 Gaining valuable practice with **debugging**, edge cases, and performance considerations.
- 🔹 Wrapping it all up with **two hands-on projects** that solidified learning and produced real-world-ready code.
